# ALX Listing App

A modern Airbnb-style listing application built using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering learning journey and is designed to demonstrate full-stack development skills through a responsive and dynamic accommodation listing interface.

## 🚀 Project Goals

The **ALX Listing App** replicates core features of a typical Airbnb listing page, including:
- A responsive layout with TailwindCSS
- Display of property listings
- Reusable components for scalability
- Modular structure for maintainability
- Optimized static assets and efficient client-side rendering

## 📁 Project Structure

Here's a high-level breakdown of the key directories:

```

.
├── components/        # Reusable UI elements (e.g., Navbar, Cards, Buttons)
├── interfaces/        # TypeScript interfaces and types for props, data models, etc.
├── constants/         # Static values (e.g., filter options, location data)
├── public/assets/     # Static images, icons, and other media files
├── pages/             # Next.js pages and route handlers
└── styles/            # Global styles and Tailwind config files

````

Each directory serves a clear and distinct purpose to support modularity and readability in the codebase.
